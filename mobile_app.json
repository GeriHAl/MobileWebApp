Rawlins immediately set his sights on bringing a Major League Soccer franchise to Central Florida within three to five years. The Club's first major accomplishment was signing Orlando Health as the jersey sponsor. Their early commitment to the Club allowed it to flourish quickly, and the Lions soon began to prove their on-field performance would match the Club’s off-field success, winning both the regular season, and ultimately the Championship in their first year, in one of the most thrilling finals in US soccer history.",

            "description": "Global Preparatory Academy, just northwest of downtown Indianapolis, has become the first school in Indiana to host a futsal-specific court on its grounds. Austin Bolyard, a physical education teacher at Global Prep and long-time supporter of NYSL Soccer League, saw the passion that his students had for the sport and wanted to create a designated space for the kids to play. He pitched his idea to IU Health, who agreed to partner with NYSL Soccer League to complete the project. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held last Friday, where officials from NYSL Soccer League, IU Health and Mayor Joe Hogsett’s Office spoke about the importance of providing athletic outlets for NYSL youth. Mariama Carson, founder and principal of Global Prep, addressed the students who were eagerly awaiting the court’s opening, emphasizing the long-lasting implications of this community project. “When you come back here as an eighth grader, a high schooler, a college student - I want you to remember the day that we came together and celebrated this new court. It will be here for years to come,” Carson enthused. Following the opening ceremony, some of the school’s fiercest futsal competitors played the inaugural match with a large crowd of their classmates cheering from the sidelines. As an organization that emphasizes community outreach and cooperation, worked with several organizations to bring futsal programming to Global Prep.",

        "habits": "Go to bed early (7-8 hours of sleep). Define your goals clearly and what you are trying to accomplish. Train smart before you train hard. Your time management and prioritization have to be excellent. Your experiences will help you grow. Your struggles, losses and disappointments will only make you stronger. Always put the team first. Be active, do cardio, lift weights and mediate so you not only keep a healthy body but a healthy mind as well. Listen more than you talk especially to your coaches, teachers and parents. I know it can be hard but I am sure you can do it. Ask coaches for feedback and improve on your weaknesses. Don’t ever complain, just work harder. Laugh often and surround yourself with positive minded people. Celebrate small goals, laugh for no reason and be the best possible teammate you can be. Respect everyone including yourself, your opponents, referees, opponents’  parents and coaches. Don’t be afraid to take risks and fail. Focus on the present and on what you can control. Your image and identity are important so build them accordingly. Every challenge is an opportunity to improve and get better. Trust your gut and take that shot. Encourage your teammates to keep on trying after their failures and tell them that everything will work out. Get comfortable with discomfort especially at training. Treat everyone the same way as you would like to be treated. Don’t judge anyone around you because you don’t know their story. Understand the rules and know the consequences. Going early to practice or games will count as being on time. Stay humble and focus on your goals with persistence and clarity. Never compare yourself with other players. Forgive others and most importantly forgive yourself as time is way to important to be wasted on that",
